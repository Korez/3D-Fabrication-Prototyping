# 3D-Fabrication-Prototyping. Uni Oulu 2016.

This repository is for the 3D fabrication and prototyping course in the University of Oulu. The idea of the course was to fabricate and prototype a some kind of 3D model which has some moving parts, sensors and functions. Main aspect was to familiarize to 3D-modeling and then create a prototype with simple functionality. 

The implemented model is a miniature of a specific car model. The idea came from one of our group member's old car. At the end the idea was chosen because it responded so well to the demands of the course. Catia was used to model car body-chassis, frame and tyres.

The body, chassis and tyres of the car were 3D-printed in Fab Lab Oulu. The car has some features which are front lights, power switch, DC-motor to move and knocking sensor to control the car. The car goes forward by knocking the car first time and it changes the direction (reverse) when knocked again. In this case piezo element is used as a knock sensor on the roof of the car. You can switch the motor and LEDs on and off from the power switch.

The electronic components used in the project were 7.4 V LiPo battery, DC-motor, two red 5mm LEDs, toggle switch, piezo element, Arduino Micro, H-bridge motor driver and PCB for it and some peripheral passive components and wiring.
