# 3D-Fabrication-Prototyping

This repository is for the 3D fabrication and prototyping course in the University of Oulu. The idea of the course was to fabricate and prototype a some kind of 3D model which has some moving parts, sensors and functions.

The model is a miniature of a specific car model. The idea came from one of our group member's old car. At the end the idea was chosen because it responded so well to the demands of the course. 

The body, chassis and tyres of the car were 3D-printed in Fab lab. The car has some features which are front lights, power switch, DC-motor to move and knocking sensor to control the car. The car goes forward by knocking the car and it changes the direction (reverse) when knocked again. You can switch the motor and LEDs on and off from the power switch. 

The electronic components used in the project were 7.4 V LiPo battery, DC-motor, two red 5mm LEDs, toggle switch, piezo element, Arduino Micro, H-bridge motor driver and PCB for it and some passive components and wiring.
